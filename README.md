## How To Use

- Type solve in the textfield to start calculating the estimate value for PI

- Type reset in the textfield to clear the points and end the current calculation

## Features

- Use monte carlo algorithm (random points) to calculate the estimate value for PI

- Use Pythagorean Theorem to calculate if the point is inside or outside of the circle

- Use the inside points (points inside of the circle) divided by the total points we plotted to get the ratio

- Since we know the area formula for the circle (πr2)

- Use the ratio to multiply the square area to get the circle area then divide by the square of the radius 

- PI= (Area of the square) * (Ratio) / (Radius * Radius)
